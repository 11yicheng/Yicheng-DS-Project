
Final Unified Feature Set (15-20 features):

1. dur — Reflects the connection duration; important in detecting longer or shorter connections typical of certain attacks like Worms and Reconnaissance.
2. sbytes — Indicates the amount of data sent; lower in several attacks like Shellcode, Backdoors, and Reconnaissance, useful for detecting stealthy data transfers.
3. dbytes — Reflects the data received, very low in attacks like Shellcode and Reconnaissance, indicative of unidirectional observational traffic.
4. spkts — Represents the count of packets sent; typically lower in attacks such as Fuzzers and Worms, highlighting less intense communication.
5. dpkts — Destination packet count, which is usually lower in attacks like Fuzzers and Worms, marking subdued response patterns.
6. sload — Captures data throughput at the source; important in detecting high load characteristic of DoS and high variability witnessed in attacks like Shellcode.
7. dload — Reflects destination data throughput, useful in identifying unidirectionality or idle responses in attacks like Fuzzers.
8. sttl — Time to live value from source, displaying variance in attacks like Reconnaissance and Worms; indicative of transmission paths or TTL manipulation.
9. tcprtt — TCP round trip time, shows delay anomalies associated with Shellcode and Reconnaissance, which reflects protocol negotiation issues.
10. synack — Time between SYN and SYN-ACK, useful for detecting abnormal handshake patterns in attacks such as Shellcode.
11. ackdat — Displays anomalies in acknowledgment setup time, characteristic of Shellcode and Reconnaissance.
12. ct_srv_src — Number of connections from the same service and source, lower in attacks like Shellcode, indicating reduced persistence.
13. ct_srv_dst — Number of connections to the same service and destination, highlights repeated service engagement evident in attacks like DoS and Exploits.
14. ct_dst_ltm — Frequency of connections to the same destination over time, revealing pattern diversity in Worms and Exploratory attacks.
15. state — Provides insight into the connection state of the protocol, differentiating traffic marked by states like 'INT' and 'FIN' in attacks.
16. service — Reveals the service targeted; essential to distinguish anomalies like high 'unknown' in Shellcode and Reconnaissance, to pinpoint service-specific threats.
